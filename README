About
-----
Frapix is a free utility to view and optionally limit the framerate of
any UNIX OpenGL program. Additionally it lets you capture still images
and videos (image sequences only at the moment) from OpenGL programs.

Essentially frapix, is very similar to the popular proprietary
windows-only fraps program, without being an exact clone.

Build
-----
To compile frapix you will need libimago, get it from
http://github.com/jtsiomb/libimago and install it before continuing
further.

Just type make to compile frapix, then make install as root to install
it system-wide. The default installation prefix is /usr/local, feel free
to modify the first line of the makefile to change this if you prefer to
install somewhere else.

Usage
-----
Just prefix the frapix script to any program you wish to run with it. So
for instance: frapix glxgears

Commandline options:
  -f <fps> will attempt to limit the framerate to <fps>.
  -u <interval> same as above, but specifying the interval between
     frames in milliseconds instead of the target framerate.

If you'd rather use frapix with any program ran from a particular
terminal, just export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libfrapix.so and it will
stick. In this case, if you want to set framerate limits as above,
you'll have to use the equivalent enviroment variables:
FRAPIX_FPS_LIMIT=<fps> or FRAPIX_FPS_UPDATE_RATE=<interval>.

While running with frappix you may press F12 at any time to capture a
screenshot, which will be saved as /tmp/frapix####.tga, incrementing the
number each time you do so. F11 starts a video capture, which just dumps
a tga sequence in the same way.

The key bindings, and output directory/filenames, should become
user-configurable at some point in the future. For now feel free to edit
frapix.c around line 170 to change them.
